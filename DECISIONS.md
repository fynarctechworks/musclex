# Decisions taken autonomously

Choices made without being able to ask, with the reasoning. Anything here is
reversible — flag it if you disagree.

Format: **what** · why · where it lives.

## Pre-existing (agreed with you earlier, recorded for completeness)

- **uniwind, not NativeWind** — the only Tailwind-for-RN engine declaring
  React 19 / RN 0.81+, which is this stack. NativeWind 4 targets older RN and 5
  is preview.
- **Tokens mirror `frontend/`, not `member-app`** — primary is ink (#171717),
  red is reserved for destructive. Mapping primary to MuscleX red made
  "Collect payment" and "Delete" identical.
- **Role-adaptive tabs derived from the permission map, never the role name** —
  gyms author custom roles via `/settings/roles`, so a per-role table misses them.
